# Signal-Level API

**Please note:** all of the functions described here are for *offline* sound synthesis only! 
If you want to define virtual instruments that interact with Euterpea in real time, take a look at the [VividEuterpea](https://github.com/donya/VividEuterpea) repository, 
which provides a bridge between Euterpeaâ€™s music structures and constructing instruments using the Vivid library for real time audio in Haskell.

This page gives a list of important datatypes and functions in Euterpea for working with music at the signal level. 
For more information on the functions, types, and type classes listed here, please see the Haskell School of Music textbook or, 
from GHCi with Euterpea imported, type the following:
