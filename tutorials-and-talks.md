# Video Tutorials

[Getting Started with Euterpea](https://youtu.be/Da7qwYADeds) (somewhat outdated) – a video tutorial on YouTube describing what to do to install 
Euterpea and test that the play function is working. Note: this video was made quite a while ago and the installation 
methods have since changed (see the Euterpea Homepage for details), but everything else is still relevant.

### Pattern-Based Algorithmic Music with Euterpea (Slides + Video)
Talk by Donya Quick. Demo at FARM Workshop at ICFP 2018. 
A demo that illustrates the creation of algorithmic melodies using the Euterpea library for music representation and creation in Haskell. 
The music created builds from very direct interpretations of random number sequences to more structured phrases built on small, stochastically recurring pitch patterns.

### Algorithmic Music in Haskell (Slides Only)
Talk by Donya Quick at Haskell Symposium at ICFP 2017. An invited talk that covers the libraries Euterpea, Kulitta, and MusECI. It addresses the distinction between algorithmic and automated composition, 
and gives a range of examples of working with music in a functional domain. It includes examples of using Euterpea to create algorithmic music, 
an overview of the Kulitta automated composition system, and a discussion of the MusECI library’s approach to modeling natural language for music.

### Math, Music, and Computation (Video Only)
Talk by Paul Hudak at Tilde Café, 2014. [Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/UVcXNhgVr9o). 
A discussion of computer music and algorithmic composition given by Paul Hudak using Euterpea. Please note that this video predates the release of 
Euterpea 2 and therefore uses Euterpea 1. The later Euterpea 2 is still very similar to Euterpea 1, but there are still some important API differences. See the Change Log for information on what changed from Euterpea 1 to Euterpea 2.
